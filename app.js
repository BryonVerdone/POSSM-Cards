Having no social awareness he then formed a band and made his friends and family pretend to be fans. Earl is having a blast being a part of POSSM, surfing whenever possible and hanging out with his wife Jane and 6 year-old daughter Lillian. He is the oldest member of the bandâ€¦ but just barely.',

    text: `A former high school student of Earl's, he spends most of his free time swiping right on Tinder and driving from Mansfield to play shows in Hartford. Jeremy is POSSM's Bass and sometimes lead guitar player and reels in the cougars with his sexy riffs and sweet sweet vocals. Jer has earned his masters in Spanish from ECSU and recently returned from a sabbatical living and working in Central America to immerse himself in the language and culture.`,

    text: 'Ben earned his graduate degree from The Hartt School of Music in composition and holds a degree in percussion which makes him wildly underqualified to hold any job in the real world and wildly overqualified to play in POSSM. Ben moved to Connecticut from Colorado and has since grown a fantastic mustache. Ben has fallen in love with the Hartford community and appreciates the opportunity play fun music with guys that are almost as handsome as he is.',
